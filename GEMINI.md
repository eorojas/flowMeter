# Gemini Project Context: FlowMeter

## Project Overview
<!-- Describe what FlowMeter does. Example: A CLI tool to measure network traffic or water flow simulation. -->
FlowMeter is a...

## Goals
1.  **Primary:** Learn the Go programming language (Golang).
2.  **Secondary:** Build a functional application to [describe core function].

## Technology Stack
-   **Language:** Go (Latest stable)
-   **Key Libraries:** (List them here as you add them, e.g., Cobra for CLI, Gin for Web)

## Coding Preferences & Conventions
-   **Style:** Idiomatic Go (Effective Go standards).
-   **Comments:** Since I am learning, please provide detailed comments explaining *why* certain Go features (like channels, goroutines, interfaces) are used.
-   **Error Handling:** Explicit error checking (standard `if err != nil`).

## Roadmap
- [ ] Initialize Go module (`go mod init`)
- [ ] Create basic "Hello World" or entry point
- [ ] Implement core logic
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Refactor for better structure

## Useful Commands
-   Run project: `go run .`
-   Test project: `go test ./...`
-   Build: `go build -o flowMeter`

## Notes
<!-- Add any specific concepts you are struggling with or want to focus on here. -->
